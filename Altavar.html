            With his things packed and his teacher Niobe following behind. The two set off up the mountain pass to the north because Altavar heard of a clan of Goliaths settled near the peaks who were known for their combat prowess, but he was always warned to never venture up there because they were called savages and brutes. Not unfamiliar with being called these words himself he ventured forth to see what they were like with his own eyes. After meeting with and besting one of their warriors he was invited to join the tribe for a few days of rest and duels with the other tribe members. Niobe also being allowed to stay because she wasn’t too bad of a fighter herself and was the teacher of someone that bested one of their tribe members.<br><br>

They stayed with the tribe for about 2 years as Altavar learned from them how to better utilize the rage from within him and control it instead of being controlled by it, which seemed to mostly work. He started to discover through bouts with the tribe members that his rage was slightly different than what he saw in the other members. He went to Niobe to ask her what it could be and while she explains the theories she crafted since first seeing it when he was a child, but it was something she has never seen before, not a spark of arcane, divine, or even druidic magics. It was something primal and wild.<br><br>

Determined to identify and master control over this mysterious source of chaotic energy, Altatvar bid farewell to the tribe and with Niobe departed from the tribe in search of legends or stories of older and more chaotic magics or energy in its purest form untouched by Divine or Arcane means.  The 2 traveled from place to place, Altavar following tales of great fighters and tournaments he would often join both for practice and to see if he could feel this spark himself which he has yet to notice, all while Niobe follows closely behind observing his growth still teaching him better ways of using his energy and movements in a fight for efficiency but also making sure he doesn’t stray too far from their actual destinations as he follows his fights. Niobe took him to several locations around their side of the world that she knew of with great nexus points of magics and ley lines.<br><br>

In these journeys Niobe took interest in cataloging and trying different flora from these sited and concocted medicines and potions for Altavar both for recovery after fights but as well as attempts to send him into trance like sessions in hopes of helping him connect with his inner power in learning to draw it out which often didn’t work and either just had him sleep for the night or random temporary magical side effects like change in skin color, loss of hair, or rapid growth of hair, or even something as whimsical as breathing bubbles as you talk.<br><br>

After 5 years of roaming around and following rumors Altavar had just finished winning a fight at the arena of the town they were in when one of the fighters told him a story of a fighter who fought at that arena long before, who was known as the Wild Soul. A story of how he fought with ferocity as well as magic. Returning to Niobe and telling her this same story, it sparked a memory of a book she once saw at the monastery about a warrior who fought with untamed magics.<br><br>

*Tragedy of the Monetary event*<br><br>

Finally getting away and being calmed down by Niobe after seeing the place he grew up in fall and one of his childhood friends fall right in front of him weighed heavy on his soul as he held no animosity toward the people he grew up with even after getting exiled. A few nights later Niobe brings up a book that she found as the monastery was being assaulted but it was in a language that neither of them could recognize save for one word in the title “Dumonoun uvir Altavars”. Finding someone who knew what this script was, it was discovered that it was of an old language of shifters known as Quori who translated the title which stood for “Dominion over Dark Spirits”. Unfortunate not only was the book in an older language but it was also written in code and shorthand as if it was someone’s journal notes. Spending the next 3 years almost identical to how they spent the previous 7 only this time they had a clear goal and direction as Niobe attempted to translate and decipher the book while Altavar fought and trained his body.<br><br>
