        <p>After Vera fled the monastery, she ended up wandering for a while. She was panicked and<br> paranoid. Her goal was to put as much distance from the city where she killed the merchant.<br> She went from town to town, stealing only what she needed. During this time, she honed<br> her talent in stealth and thievery. Vera also continued to practice the combat arts taught<br> to her by the monks at the monastery. She adapted her training to fighting with two<br> weapons and adding more underhanded tactics. Afterall, she's fighting for survival.<br> She continued to practice her worship of Selûne. She found comfort in the message<br> but struggles to be devout. One night, under the light of the full moon, she was<br> camping in the woods just outside a village. Just before she could fall asleep,<br> she came under attack by…something. It moved in the shadows and rendered<br> her unconscious. When she awoke, her hair had a white streak from the<br> root of her hair to the end. Even now, at the age of 20, she continues her<br> life of stealing from the wealthy and donating to those less fortunate.<br> Even while on the run.</p>
