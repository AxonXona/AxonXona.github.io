        <p>After Vera fled the monastery, she ended up wandering for a while. She was panicked and paranoid. Her goal was to put as much distance from the city where she killed the merchant as she could. She went from town to town, stealing only what she needed. During this time, she honed her talent in stealth and thievery. Vera also continued to practice the combat arts taught to her by the monks at the monastery. She adapted her training to fighting with two weapons and adding more underhanded tactics. Afterall, she's fighting for survival. She continued to practice her worship of Selûne. She found comfort in the message but struggles to be devout. One night, under the light of the full moon, she wad camping in the woods just outside a village. Just before she could fall asleep she came under attack by…something. It moved in the shadows and rendered her unconscious. When she awoke, her hair had a white streak from the root of her hair to the end. Even now, at the age of 20, she continues her life of stealing from the wealthy and donating to those less fortunate while simultaneously searching for the one who attacked her hoping to find answers about the changes in her hair.</p>
