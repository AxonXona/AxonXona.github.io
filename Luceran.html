            Luceran left the monastery bright-eyed eager to see what the world had to offer.  He loved the monastery but always felt a pressure to excel that other students weren't subjected to.  He would be free of this feeling for at least a year, he would think to himself.<br><br>

            At first, he saw fit to simply wander up the Sword Coast, taking note of every interesting person he met and place he found. His detail was meticulous in his writings, intent on turning each discovery into a treasured memory for the future.  Once he made it to Waterdeep, however, he began to grow tired of the big cities and decided to adjust his heading toward the east where great forests and natural wonders would surely await him.<br><br>

            Eventually this trek took him to the small town of Silverymoon, which he found to be quaint and even a bit drab, but ended up staying much longer than he expected.  On his very first night in town, he met the barmaid Elora, an elven woman barely past her first century.  Luceran was instantly enchanted by her and soon found himself spending most of his free time in her tavern.  It didn't take long for Elora to return his advances.  This isn't to say Luceran was some sort of casanova, but the two of them quickly discovered they wanted the same things.<br><br>

            Elora descended from minor elven nobility but didn't care for the politicking and drama of day-to-day life at court.  So she secreted away to Silverymoon 20 or so years prior to her and Luceran's meeting.  Luceran also learned that she was a part-time student at a local school of Thaumaturgy and was a somewhat competent mage.<br><br>

            They were together for a time, never wed, despite the nagging from their peers.  Luceran helped sustain their lifestyle by finding work at a local Selunite temple, freelance jewelry crafting, and even helped out at Elora's tavern some odd nights.  The next several months passed by quickly, as they often do in times of comfort and contentment.  Luceran had only intended to be away from home for a year and the time had already come to part ways with not just the people he had met in Silverymoon, but the life he had made for himself.  But  he did not pack his belongings, he did not say his goodbyes, and he did not depart Silverymoon.  His pilgrimage turned sabbatical turned self-imposed exile would continue indefinitely for as long as he saw fit.  A life away from the pressure and expectations of the monastery, one that he had built himself and won not through the circumstances of his birth, but through hard work and adventure, was the one he had chosen, come what may.<br><br>
            
            This simple and peaceful state of being seemed to last, until just a few bad harvests caused the local barony to begin putting massive pressure on the peasant class of Silverymoon.  Tax hikes, vastly lowered security, and shakedowns from the soldiers in town became the order of the day here.  Silverymoon, in the care of Baron Stuart Elmont, wasn't a large town nor an economic paradise by any measure.  The townsfolk made their money primarily through farming, logging, and brewing, and tourism to their centers of worship.  They could not keep up with the demands that the barony was making and they began to fall apart.  Food and labor shortages were now major problems that the citizens of Silverymoon would have to contend with, in addition to the many pressures from local nobility.<br><br>
          
            It didn't take long for the peasantry to get restless.  People began organizing something of a resistance, gathering peasant muscle around vulnerable farmers and tradespeople to protect what little they had from the Baron Elmont.  Luceran and Elora were not idle while all this was happening.  They took to the streets and assisted organization efforts wherever they could.  This effort typically took the form of creating and safeguarding supply lines and maintaining a peasant militia, the members of which eventually started seeing a pair of leaders in Luceran and Elora.  Luceran passed on as much of his monastery training as he could and Elora did what she could with her magical ability.  No outright battles had occurred yet but it never hurts to be prepared, right?<br><br>

            The two of them never pictured themselves as leaders, despite what they stood to inherit at birth.  This was just another feather of pride in Luceran’s cap, as far as he was concerned.<br><br>
            
            All of this came to a head one quiet spring morning.  A group of guards paid a visit to one of the city’s highest producers of barley thinking it’d be an easy payday.  The farmer fought back and in the ensuing chaos he and his son were killed.  News of this spread like wildfire across Silverymoon before the day’s end.  The populace snapped and Luceran and Elora agreed that direct action was required.  The Silverymoon United Militia, as it had come to be known, was taken to the baron’s manor at dusk with Luceran, Elora, and several other key figures leading the charge.  The battle was hard-fought and Luceran did not come out unscathed, both physically and emotionally.  The peasant militia, armed only with pitchforks and primitive pikes, vastly outnumbered Elmont’s security, though this did not protect them from nearly being decimated.  Their number was reduced to nearly a third of what they were that morning.  Their efforts were fruitful, however, as in only a few short hours Elmont’s head adorned one of their makeshift pikes and the spoils of battle were shared among the surviving citizenry.  The town then entered a time of great mourning.<br><br>
         
            The death toll reached the low hundreds.  Many denizens of Silverywood lost beloved husbands, wives, and children as a result of this carnage.  But they could see the light at the end of the tunnel.  This would be a new beginning for Silverywood.<br><br>

            And unfortunately it was.  One week later, Luceran and Elora awoke to the sound of hundreds of heavy footfalls.  The noble Baron Elmont, it seems, was very well-connected.  They tried to leave their home and investigate the goings on, but their door had been barricaded shut from the outside.  Elora started to smell smoke, screams erupted from every corner of Silverywood, a cull had been ordered.  The nerve of these upstart revolutionaries could only be quelled by righteous flame.  The pair found themselves in a panic and started to look for alternative means of escape but it was no use.  Windows were nailed shut, the door was locked tight, not a single opening in this building could accommodate a person’s body.  Smoke began to fill the space and the last look Luceran ever saw on Elora’s face was one of sheer terror and dread.  A crash came from the ceiling and that was it.  Darkness.  The destiny of their home and everything they had built over the past 7 years was to serve as an example to any who would dare to question the divine right of their rulers.<br><br>
        
            Hours passed, maybe even days.  Luceran didn’t want to wake up.  He was barely conscious but on some level he knew what he would see as soon as he opened his eyes.  Luceran awoke in a pile of debris and cold ash.  He scanned his surroundings and found only blackened stone and scattered embers as far as he could see, save for the shriveled up hand that was peeking out from a pile of rubble, clearly reaching towards him.<br><br>
        
            It’s face was unrecognizable.  Teeth, eyes, nose, face, gone.  Pointed ears.  A brass ring on the right index finger.  Never had Luceran felt such a finely distilled sense of dread.  He was drowning in it.  He ran through every stage of grief in seconds, over and over.  Wordlessly, he grabbed everything of his that survived the fire and took the withered remains of his love into his arms and walked north into the woods.<br><br>
       
            What was he to do now?  He walked as far as his feet would take him.  His knees began to buckle with every step sometime after the sun came up.  In tears, wailing and hollering, he cobbled together a makeshift grave and gave Elora her last rites in traditional Selunite fashion, though he did not feel Selûne with him that day.  He swore to remember every feature of this place, every tree, shrub, and flower.  He would return, but he had to keep moving.  He had to.<br><br>

            The next few weeks were a blur.  He lived off the land as best he could but he was raised with rigid structure in civilization.  He was shell shocked and guilt ridden, equal parts thankful and regretful he wasn’t made to witness the rest of the carnage that took place in Silverymoon.  Spite is a very powerful feeling, however.  He felt himself changed after the attack, his blood’s connection to the power of fire strengthened.  Before, he was capable of conjuring a bit of flame.  Child’s play for a fire elemental.  But now he could draw forth much more powerful effects.  He avoided civilization as best he could and continued to hone these new abilities.<br><br>
        
            Luceran would go on to wander the wilds of Faerun for nearly 3 years.  Surviving out of spite in an indefinite period of mourning.  He would gather his mind and his strength in order to become a one man army, intent on eradicating the exploitation at the hands of the rich and powerful in righteous conflagration.<br><br>
        
            At this point in his life, Luceran’s thoughts often drifted to home.  He would daydream about the state of the monastery.  He imagined they probably held a funeral for him.  He hadn’t thought about his friends from those days in what felt like years.  His experience implanted in him a deep hatred for the nobility of Faerun and power structures in general, most of his time was spent in a quiet rage, but in those rare moments of absolute lucidity he wondered after his birth family and even felt almost at peace, once again free of pressure and responsibility.</p>
